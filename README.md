# Kosmotheon

> *An open-source, evolving knowledge base that maps the full spectrum of human consciousness, spiritual development, and cultural evolution.*

## Overview

Kosmotheon serves as a comprehensive atlas of inner and outer transformation, blending developmental models with the depth of nondual mysticism, the diversity of world traditions, and the clarity of cognitive science. It creates a unified framework to understand the unfolding of Kosmic Consciousness across individuals, cultures, and civilizations.

This knowledge base integrates:

- **Integrative Models**: Spiral Dynamics, Integral Theory, 4E Cognition, and more
- **Cross-Traditional Wisdom**: World religions, indigenous traditions, and modern spiritual movements
- **Developmental Awareness**: Understanding consciousness as an evolving, stage-based phenomenon
- **Practical Application**: Tools and frameworks for personal and collective transformation
