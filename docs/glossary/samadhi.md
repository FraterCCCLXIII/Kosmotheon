# Samadhi

> *"Samadhi is not a state of unconsciousness, but a state of super-consciousness where the mind becomes one with the object of meditation."* â€” Patanjali

## Definition

Samadhi is a Sanskrit term that refers to a state of deep meditative absorption where the mind becomes completely focused and unified with the object of meditation. It represents the highest state of concentration and is considered the eighth and final limb of Patanjali's Ashtanga Yoga. Samadhi is characterized by the complete absorption of consciousness, where the distinction between the meditator, the act of meditation, and the object of meditation dissolves into pure awareness.
